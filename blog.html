          All 67 people on board the American Airlines regional jet and US Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair Wednesday night are presumed dead – a grim tragedy that has left a heartbreaking trail of mourning families in its wake.
          <br />
          The somber day will be remembered as the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.
          <br />
          As details of the disturbing catastrophe emerge and additional bodies are identified, the full weight and impact of the lives lost grows heavier. Here are some of the victims of the tragedy identified so far.
          The female Black Hawk pilot who was co-piloting the aircraft when it collided with the passenger plane this week was a “driven and hardworking” officer who “was made for” Army aviation, those who knew her recalled to CNN on Saturday.
          <br />
          The Army officially identified the pilot as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, one of the three-person crew inside the UH-60 Black Hawk. While the Army released the names of the other two soldiers on board the Black Hawk on Friday, Lobach’s name had been withheld at her family’s request.
          <br />
          CNN previously reported Lobach was co-piloting the Black Hawk at the time of the collision on Wednesday evening.
          <br />
          A statement released Saturday by the Lobach family called her a “bright star” who was “kind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious and strong.”
          <br />
          “Rebecca was a warrior and would not hesitate to defend her country in battle. But she was as graceful as she was fierce: in addition to her duties as an Army aviator, Rebecca was honored to serve as a White House Military Social Aide, volunteering to support the President and First Lady in hosting countless White House events, including ceremonies awarding the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” the family’s statement said.
          <br />
          Capt. Bilal Kordab, an Army officer who recruited Lobach into the North Carolina National Guard while she was a student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, told CNN Lobach was “a driven and hardworking individual that absolutely worked her tail off” to accomplish what she did.
          <br />
          “She was not handed anything. She was more than qualified for anything that she was able to accomplish,” Kordab said. “She excelled in everything,” including flight school. Lobach commissioned into the Army as an active-duty aviation officer from the ROTC program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2019.
          <br />
          Chief Warrant Officer 2 Sabrina Bell, who now serves in Alaska but who previously served with Lobach in the same company at the 12th Aviation Battalion, told CNN Lobach was “head-over-heels motivated” from the moment she arrived at the unit.
          <br />
          As an officer, Lobach had a unique ability to connect with not only her soldiers but the leaders above her, Bell said. “I can easily say she is one of the best leaders that I have ever had,” Bell said.
